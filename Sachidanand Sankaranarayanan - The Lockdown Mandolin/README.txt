The Lockdown Mandolin

Created by Sachidanand Sankaranarayanan

This is my first ever sampled instrument and I am delighted to share it with you guys. 

I got this Havana Mandolin almost a year back just before a gig. Ever since then I wanted to sample and create an instrument out of this. Finally sat down and recorded the samples a week back and built this instrument.

Ever since the first time I recorded this, something about double-tracking this mandolin (and panning it halfway L and R) attracted me and so I have made this instrument in such a fashion. Each note has been played twice (with different picks) per sample and panned. This instrument has two round robins with one dynamic layer per RR. I love the dulcimer vibe that this library gives in the higher registers beacuse of the DT

This mandolin also has a bit of an intonation issue especially in the 7th-12th fret of the E string. Since I found this to be a very organic quality of the instrument, I have just applied a mild pitch correction on the samples.

There are some bonus patches that I have added for more electronic/ambient contexts.

This is a part of a more detailed version of the mandolin (that I intend to release soon) with 5 Round Robins and two dynamic layers per round robins. 

Recorded with MXL 603s and MXL 991 microphones at 48Khz/24bit in my home studio. 
Built using Kontakt 5.8.1

Happy Playing
